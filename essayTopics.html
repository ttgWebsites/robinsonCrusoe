					what effect does this have on the novel?</li>
					<li data-theme="d">Crusoe seems to lack any interest in any of the beauty his island home seems to offer.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">He spends very little time describing it, and when he does it is more so matter of fact.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">Crusoe even seems to lack any interest in beauty in an abstract form such as morality and heroism.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">The text seems to show that Defoe may as well lack the eye for beauty just like his protagonist Crusoe.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">This indifference is quite a difference from traditional literature for that time period and goes to show that art has many more purposes than just showing the beauty in life.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">Instead describing everyday life can also prove captivating and entertaining</li>
